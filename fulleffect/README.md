# Full Effect

Full Effect is an Other Metagame proposed by Smogon user Ho3nConfirm3d.
The original post can be found [here](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/metagame-workshop.3598275/post-7957631).

Currently, my best attempt at a formal definition of this OM is as follows:

Any time an Effect's event callback can take 2 different actions based on a condition,
the action taken will *always* be that which is more favorable for that effect's source,
unless:

1. The condition depends on the type of a move or Pokemon
2. The condition depends on RNG
